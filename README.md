# Maximum Likelihood in Amplitude Estimation without Phase Estimation

Quantum amplitude estimation is an important quantum algorithm
and it can be applied in many different fields. Suzuki et al. proposed a
method of amplitude estimation without phase estimation which lessens
the demand on quantum resources. However, because the likelihood function
has many local maxima, the existing maximization algorithms for
finding the global maximum are either slow, or sometime mistaken a local
maximum as the global one. This paper analyzes the analytical behavior
of the log likelihood function and proposes an efficient algorithm to find
the global maximum.
